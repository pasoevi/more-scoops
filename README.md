# scoop-bucket

A bucket with a handful of software packages I used but can't find in the main/extras scoop buckets. Once the packages are stable, I get them ported to the more widely used scoop buckets. All packages in this bucket are experimental. Instead of adding this bucket to your setup, try to see if the package you're looking for has already been ported to main/extras/games/etc buckets and use those.

All software is proided as it is, without any warranties.
