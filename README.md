# scoop-bucket

A bucket with a handful of software packages I use but can't find in the main/extras scoop buckets. 

Once the packages are stable, I get them ported to the more widely used scoop buckets. All packages in this bucket are experimental. 

Instead of adding this bucket to your setup, see if the package you're looking for hasn't already been ported to main/extras/games/etc buckets and use those.

All software is proided as it is, without any warranties. A more formal notice is to come. In short, I'm not responsible for anything.
